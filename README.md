DESCRIPTION

This release contains code and data used to implement a method of analyzing inflectional paradigm shape with information theory. The aim is to quantify the strength of implicative relations between cells by identifying "maximally confusable sets." Confusable sets of cells are those that “confuse” two microclasses in the system--that is, sets among which internal comparisons do not allow precise assignment of a verb to a single micro-class. A confusable set of cells S (size>1)is a maximally confusable set for microclasses A and B if no superset of S also confuses A and B. 

The original method of identifying maximally confusable sets highlights differences between microclasses based on both the affixes they take and the distribution of different stem allomorphs within the paradigm. To focus on purely distributional information, a parallel “deidentified” method is also implemented, which abstracts away from the forms of the distinguishers by replacing the individual characters within the distinguishers with abstract identifiers indicating the positions of identical characters. Maximally confusable sets are identified via both the original method and the deidentified method.

After identifying maximally confusable sets, the method then uses entropy to compute the degree to which each maximally confusable set of cells helps to identify the exact inflectional microclass of each verb. These entropy values are stored in a matrix of m microclasses × n sets of cells, where each entry corresponds to the entropy value associated with a set of cells for a particular microclass. This code generates entropy matrices for both the original and the deidentified analyses.

GETTING STARTED

This release was built using Python 3.7.4 (Anaconda3) in Windows 10.

It consists of the following scripts:

MaximallyConfusableSubsets.py
MaximallyConfusableSubsets_Deidentified.py
ExtractDeidentifiedDists.py
EntropyCalculations.py
aStar_matching.py
approximateMultialign.py
maxunifiedmatching.py
tsne.py

INPUT FILES

The code files require a 'plat' as input, which is a .csv file containing a table of paradigm cells. Except for the first column, each column represents a morphosyntactic property set (e.g. PRS.IND.1SG). Except for the first row, each row represents an inflectional microclass (e.g. CANTAR). Each cell thus represents the form corresponding to a particular morphosyntatic property set for a particular inflectional microclass. 

The Spanish verb plat used by the authors is provided with this release. 

USAGE

The following four scripts will run all major functions and produce entropy matrices for the input data:

MaximallyConfusableSubsets.py 
MaximallyConfusableSubsets_Deidentified.py
ExtractDeidentifiedDists.py
EntropyCalculations.py 

All four scripts require a plat in .csv format as a first argument. They should be executed in the following order:

1) MaximallyConfusableSubsets.py generates a .dump file of maximally confusable sets.
2) MaximallyConfusableSubsets_Deidentified.py generates a .dump file of deidentified maximally confusable sets.
3) ExtractDeidentifiedDists.py requires the .dump file of deidentified MC sets as a second argument and generates a .dump file of deidentified distinguishers. 
4) EntropyCalculations.py requires the .dump file of maximally confusable sets as a second argument and the .dump file of deidentified distinguishers as a third argument. It generates two matrices of entropy values as .dump files (the first for the original analysis, and the second for the deidentified analysis). 

aStar_matching.py, approximateMultialign.py, and maxunifiedmatching.py are supporting scripts. The tsne.py script can be used to run t-SNE analysis on the matrices generated by EntropyCalculations.py.

NOTES

The tsne.py file contains, with modifications, the t-SNE implementation in Python done by van der Maaten and Hinton (2008). Their Python implementation was downloaded 
from https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/ and slightly modified to meet the specifications of this project.
